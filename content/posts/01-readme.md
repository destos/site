This is the first post after setting up gatsby and customizing a starter package. Gatsby feels so hilariously over complex for solving the static site problem. I've already ran into a few issues when attempting to extent some of the site config and how it's represented in the graphql queries. Nothing too complex.

The plan is to start writing more about different topics that I care about and see if others are interested in reading along. 

There will heopfully be a wide range. We'll see what happens.
